To Do
=====
* Support R functions.
* Support :multiple_sep for multi-files.
* Package it (swt:app).
* There has to be a cleaner way to unzip master.zip in EnveGUI::home.
* List top-5 most frequently used scripts in EnveGUI::home.
* Search!
* :see_also in tasks.
* "Soft :requires" (:suggests ?) for optional requirements like the
  rest-client gem in aai.rb/ani.rb.
* Check for available updates (instead of relying on user checking).
  Perhaps with the github API?
* Auto-add :requires based on the language (ruby, perl, bash, etc).
